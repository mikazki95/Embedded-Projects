Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:baste:24 - All of the external outputs in this design are using
   slew-rate-limited output drivers.  The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the original
   design.  Please see your vendor interface documentation for specific
   information on how to do this within your design-entry tool.
   Note: You should be careful not to designate too many outputs which switch
   together as fast, because this can cause excessive ground bounce.  For more
   information on this subject, please refer to the IOB switching characteristic
   guidelines for the device you are using in the Programmable Logic Data Book.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) removed
   8 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "$I381/D3" is loadless and has been removed.
 Loadless block "$I381/$1I30/$I381/D3" (X_AND2) removed.
  The signal "$I381/D3/2.0" is loadless and has been removed.
   Loadless block "$I381/$1I30/$I381/D3/2.0" (X_AND2) removed.
    The signal "$I381/E" is loadless and has been removed.
The signal "$I57/E" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "$I66/CE" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "$I66/CLR" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "$I319/CE" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "$I319/CLR" is sourceless and has been removed.

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
environment variable MAP_REPORT_DETAIL to TRUE and rerun map.
